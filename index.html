  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a senior at Webster University. I have taken a few beginner classes in the past about creating website. One class that I took involved creating a site with WordPress. My current major is in Media Production. The parts of media production that I like to do the most involve video editing and audio editing.

  <p>Here is a quote </p>
  <blockquote cite="http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html">
    <p>There is no deliberate pattern to the stories that I have chosen to make into films. About the only factor at work each time is that I try not to repeat myself. Since you can't be systematic about finding a story to film, I read anything. In addition to books which sound interesting, I rely on luck and accident to eventually bring me together with the book. I read as unself consciously as I can to avoid interfering with the story's emotional impact. If the book proves to be exciting and suggests itself as a possible choice, subsequent readings are done much more carefully, usually with notes taken at the same time.</p>
